    Going for walks is one of my favorite ways to get exercise. It's nice to have a good chill activity you can do almost anywhere. For me, the setting of my walk is extremely important as I love having something nice to look at and an environment I can engage with.

                Laumeier Sculpture Park in St. Louis is like this awesome outdoor art gallery mixed with a nature hike. It's huge, covering over 100 acres, and it's filled with these crazy cool sculptures. Picture giant metal shapes, funky installations, and all sorts of weird and wonderful stuff just sitting out in nature. You can wander around, check out the art, and soak up the natural beauty all around you. It's like stepping into a whole other world where art and nature high-five each other!

                Lewis Park in University City is like the chill spot for locals. It's not massive, but it's got everything you need for a laid-back day outdoors. There's a pond in the middle where ducks hang out, and you can sit on benches by the water and just relax. For the kids, there's a playground with swings and slides to keep them entertained. It's the kind of place where you can take a leisurely stroll or just kick back and enjoy the peaceful vibe.

                Crandon Park in Key Biscayne is straight-up paradise. The beach is unreal, with soft sand and clear blue water that's perfect for swimming. You've got these lush trees and mangroves all around, making it feel like you're in some tropical dream. Plus, there are trails to explore and even coral reefs if you're into snorkeling. Families love it 'cause there's so much to do â€“ from building sandcastles to kayaking. Basically, it's the ultimate beach day spot where you can just chill and soak up the sun.
